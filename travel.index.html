            World Heritage Site. Various styles and techniques such as Baroque, Renaissance and Classic are represented
            here in over 5,000 buildings included in the catalogue.[24] The historic centre is filled with churches,
            monasteries, mansions and the like, mostly done in gray cantera stone, red brick and decorated with
            multicolored tiles. Puebla is also considered to be the "cradle of Mexican Baroque" both in architecture and
            in the decorative arts, and one of the five most important colonial cities in Mexico.</p>

            origami, onsen, Geisha and games. Japan has a developed system for the protection and promotion of both
            tangible and intangible Cultural Properties and National Treasures. Twenty-two sites have been inscribed on
            the UNESCO World Heritage List, eighteen of which are of cultural significance.Japan is considered a
            cultural superpower.The culture of Japan has left a lasting impact within global cultural flows, across
            numerous arts and media industries;in genres and lifestyles as diverse as abstract art, Christian media,
            electronic dance music, science fiction, and Westerns.</p>

            forms in Saudi Arabia. This art has been emerging in different themes such as metalwork, ceramics, glass
            textiles, painting, and sculpture.
            Apart from the dominant art forms, there were some portrait paintings and sculptures produced by some
            artists in the 1960s like Artist Dia Aziz Dia from Jeddah. Al-Qatt Al-Asiri is another essential art form

            women. The base of this art is white gypsum with colorful patterns of geometric shapes and symbol painted on
            it.[224] This art form is now inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.</p>
